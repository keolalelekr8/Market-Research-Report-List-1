<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenge Vehicle Airbag Inflator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic Inflator</li><li>Stored Gas Inflator</li><li>Hybrid Inflator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The passenger vehicle airbag inflator market comprises three main types: pyrotechnic inflators, stored gas inflators, and hybrid inflators. Pyrotechnic inflators utilize a chemical reaction to rapidly produce gas, deploying airbags in a crash. Stored gas inflators release pre-compressed gas to inflate airbags quickly. Hybrid inflators combine both methods, using a pyrotechnic charge to initiate gas release from a stored gas supply, optimizing performance and reliability. Each type offers distinct advantages in terms of deployment speed, complexity, and cost-effectiveness for vehicle safety.</p></p>
